### 문제 설명

<p>It was a dark and dreary Christmas Eve when our hero pondered, weak and weary, over a quaint and curious COCI task. When he nodded, nearly napping, suddenly he heard a tapping, tapping and a mighty roar. A giant reindeer broke through his chamber door, merely this and nothing more. While our hero’s heart slightly fluttered, the beast simply uttered: “I won’t leave until you solve this problem”.</p>

<p>In the problem you were given two integers N and M and you were supposed to perfectly match the numbers from sets A = {0, 1, 2, . . . , N − 1} and B = {M, . . . , M + N − 1} into N pairs, such that for the matched numbers x ∈ A and y ∈ B it holds x & y = x, where & denotes a bitwise AND operation.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ M, N + M ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>) from the task description.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>You should output N lines and in each line you should output two integers x and y, where x belongs to set A and y belongs to set B. Numbers in each line should correspond to one of the matched pairs from task description.</p>

<p>It is possible to prove that the solution always exists.</p>
